                <p> A freshly brewed Rooibos tea blended with 100% unsweetened fruit juices and pulps. Frutea<sup>&reg;</sup> is exactly what it says – a fruity tea – and can be enjoyed hot or cold.</p>
                <!--<h2><span class="reg">How did</span> <span class="bol green"><strong>Rooibos Frutea</strong><sup>&reg;</sup></span> <span class="reg">start</span></h2>
                <p>Even while my husband, Konrad, was courting me, he always brought along with him a brew of Rooibos and fruit juice that he made. His dream has always been to bring a healthy beverage into the market - especially for children. Konrad doesn't like fizzy drinks or any artificial aftertastes, so we started making our own Rooibos iced teas at home.</p>
                <p>Konrad spent many hours and basically years on a business plan with a state of the art production line. His dream was too big for me - it involved millions of rands.</p>
                <p>I was willing to give it a go starting small. So I began the venture by brewing pots of Rooibos tea in my kitchen - mixing it with 100% fruit concentrates and pulps. We developed a few flavours. We had a lots of tasting sessions with close friends, and did some research together with the Department of Consumer Science where they did a taste profile and compared to the ideal iced tea, we did very well. I joined the Slow Food Market every Saturday in Stellenbosch and we saw interest in our product growing slowly.</p>
                <p>I would say we launched our flagship - <strong>ROOIBOS FRUTEA</strong><sup>&reg;</sup> at Kamersvol Geskenke November 2008. This was a big test to see if more people than my close family and friends also loved our product. Up to this time I did it as a hobby and still had a full time job. The result was very positive and we signed up our first restaurant.</p>
                <p>Another major leap of faith was attending the Good Food and Wine Show in May 2009. With having only one outlet and no distribution channel, I really just wanted to test the wider public's reaction to our product. There was great interest from the public and we were approached by a few big buyers. We signed up our second client (this time an upmarket chain store) - Melissa's Food Shop.</p>
